	<!-- Proof of concept I made for my old call center job that would have improved 
        phone agents' workflow and productivity, but now sits as a shrine to my former 
        employer's stupidity and a playground where I test random junk. I know it is 
        unprofessional to bad mouth your old boss like this, but they made me feel bad 
        for trying to solve the problems I faced as one of their agents. So fuck them. 
        No seriously, not talking just hurt feelings here, they spent an hour breaking me down.
        I just wanted to make my job a little easier. Every bit of this they have coming and worse.
        
        The script tab used to contain the script an agent would read, as the script was when I 
        worked there, but I removed it so as not to violate any copyrights. My improvements 
        were to remove the customer info from the static flow of the html to a dynamic panel,
        so agents could access that info on any page of the script without having to scroll 
        back thru a buttload of pages to find it, only to scroll again to find where they 
        left off (because the morons who wrote the scripts originally weren't phone agents 
        and didn't think we would need that info anywhere but page one, when page one was 
        one of the only places we didn't usually need it, and also they did not include any way 
        to easily navigate the script, because they weren't very good programmers either). 
        I also added tabs to frequently used resources, like pdfs of application forms, 
        links to the client websites, things the agents needed all the time, but was always 
        stored in a less convenient location that required you to access it through a seperate 
        program entirely, cluttering the screen, and frustrating the agents. I was lectured 
        for an hour by people who didn't know the first thing about html for writing this. 
        They reprimanded me for accessing systems I should not be accessing, to which I 
        responded "What systems? Notepad and Internet Explorer? Kinda can't do my job without 
        them." They didn't like that. Rather than actually look at what I made (you know, back 
        when it actually demostrated its usefulness instead of just being a sandbox for me 
        to test functions), they made it abundantly clear, excessively so, that I wasn't hired to code, and 
        therefore they would not consider anything I ever wrote to be of any value. I was hired 
        to take calls, and not be useful to anyone, and should be thankful to even have a job,
        because clearly as one of their phone agents, I could only be a talentless lying piece of shit.
        
        Fuck ALL that.
        
        They have since lost their offices to companies that can actually afford the rent, 
        and I'm still writing code. I also moderate FreeCodeCamp Earth, the largest facebook 
        group for people learning to code, and help people become developers. 
        And I'm doing just fine, without a fucking job. I'm a homemaker, programmer, and magician.
        
        Someday, Brent Clairmont and the fucking idiots at CustomerLink, a ClearResult 
        Company, may politely fuck-off into forgotten obscurity, barely even a footnote in 
        my life story. Your ineptitude is why you're losing clients, Brent. The way you treat 
        employees is why nobody worth a damn ever stays, Brent. Your inability to grow some 
        nuts and take chances, or to consider that maybe some of your phone agents aren't so 
        dumb they can't do anything else and therefore should be thankful to you for giving 
        them the opportunity to toil away under your incompetent management, is why 
        CustomerLink has the reputation it does as a shit show, Brent. And what the fuck was up with
        giving Sarah that promotion literally two weeks after she fucked up the entire network by 
        downloading a virus and sending it to everyone who worked there? Casey totally deserved 
        that manager job. Another fun fact about Sarah, she was incredibly inept as a supervisor as 
        well. Chewed me out for discussing "Linux" with a customer, once. Wrote me up for it, even. 
        Stupid girl didn't consider for a moment she misheard me say "Lennox", which is what I 
        actually said, and the record proved it. Lennox is the manufacturer of heating and air systems, 
        which would make sense as a thing I'd talk about with a customer, seeing as how my shitty job 
        was rebate processing on eco-friendly HVAC systems. Also, the dumb little girl thought my story 
        of needing to be home so I could put my son on the bus every morning was some made up bullshit, 
        that I was just lazy, and denied my every request to change my schedule, and then bitched at me 
        for being late all the time. Fuck you, Sarah! I'm really a single dad, and my son really is autistic. 
        He really can't get himself on the bus. I really needed my schedule changed because I really didn't 
        have help in the morning, and the next bus I could take to work after putting my son on a bus to 
        school really would not get me to work on time, Sarah. Don't know how I could explain it any better 
        than the time I actually brought my son in to work so you could see he was real. I don't know why you 
        thought I was lying about that, but I hope you die horribly, preferrably a very painful, slow 
        kind of cancer. Yeah, I have a pretty good idea what I'm wishing on you, and no, I won't feel 
        the slightest bit bad if it actually happens. You deserve it, because of how incredibly stupid 
        you are. You are the worst kind of person, Sarah. Evil. And I actually liked you, before you were my 
        boss and I got to know you. Like, I kinda had a crush on you, a little. Saw you around. Thought you were smart, 
        and adorable. So happy I learned what kind of psychotic person you really are. Dodged that bullet.
        How do you have any friends? Do they not know the way you refuse to let people fix the things you 
        take issue with, just so that you can continue taking issue with it, making yourself feel better, and 
        making them feel like shit? Months, Sarah, months. That's how long I fought with you on the issue of 
        when I am available to start work in the morning. How did I finally get you to approve my schedule change 
        so I wasn't late every day? Oh, yeah, I pointed out to someone you weren't in charge of that I could probably 
        sue if you continued to ignore the multiple requests I submitted to you, while you continued to write me up. 
        My, how quick you changed your fucking tune when you got the same info I had been giving you for months when it 
        came from someone else. Don't know why you didn't accept it coming from me. Maybe I needed to grow a
        vagina before you gave a shit about anything I said. I don't know. But I certainly regret welcoming you
        to the team with any amount of hopefulness. You did not bring hope, you brought a dark cloud of unfiltered shit.
        Getting kicked off your team was a relief, even if it meant two years of the worst kind of phone work. 
        Rather be a shitty salesman than continue to work for you.
        
        "Careful what you wish for", Brent? What was that supposed to mean, a warning? Well, what you didn't 
        know, my wish coming true was the best thing that happened to me. All I learned is when I get my wish, good 
        things happen. Because my wishes are well thought out, you fucking moron. Sarah was an awful person towards me,
        and I never knew why she was so fucking awful towards me. She made every day terrible. Still consider the day 
        she kicked me off the team to be the second best day I ever had there, second only to the time I called 
        Harry Anderson, of Night Court fame and one of my favorite magicians. Which only happened because I got kicked 
        off of team 24. Seems to me the things I wish for are pretty fucking sweet, and work out surprisingly well, when 
        I'm not at the mercy of douchy dipshits and the dumb fucks they promote over those who really deserve it.

        That was cathartic. Honestly though, I hate those people, they really made life hell for awhile. I'm 
        glad to put it behind me, and wishing an awful fate on them and revelling in their failures is my 
        reward for having tolerated their soul-crushing practices for so long. Never work in telemarketing, folks.

                        <dt>Is it dangerous?</dt>
                        <dd>No. It uses CSS and JavaScript to bring better functionality to the scripts we already use.</dd>
                        <dt>What's the benefit?</dt>
                        <dd>Scripts that are easier to maintain; even though this looks more complicated, virtually all of the complicated bits are self contained and can be used in every script, and the product specific parts are easy to identify and modify without breaking the functionality. Also, by utilizing the full functionality of HTML and JavaScript, our scripts actually help agents reduce mistakes in data entry, and puts more information in easy to find areas.</dd>
                        <dt>Does it have to look like this?</dt>
                        <dd>You don't like it? Ouch. Just kidding. The look and feel is entirely customizable. Want the contact panel to appear from the right istead of the left? Easy. Don't like the three shades of boring this script is rendered in? Not a problem. If each team that uses five9 wants a theme that's all their own, that's a possibility too!</dd>
